      Our mission is to pay our community as much as possible for seeing ads on the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's your computer. Get paid for the ads on it.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>We have no investors to pay so we can pay our community more.</li>

      <li>We have a <a href="{% url 'privacy-policy' %}">privacy policy</a> and <a href="{% url 'terms-of-service' %}">terms of service</a> that you don't need a law degree to understand.</li>

      <li>We pay conventional money (ðŸ’µ) - not cryptocurrency.
        If buying groceries using crypto becomes commonplace, we'll consider it.</li>

      <li>Guppy code is open source. Want to help shape the Guppy community? <a href="https://github.com/guppyco" target="_blank">Find us on GitHub</a>.</li>
